# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

## Introduction
Projects worked upon during Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) using OpenAI Gym &amp; Unity ML-agents

The projects are in the order of advancements in the algorithms used in Deep RL. I'll soon be sharing more implementations of some of the most popular environments in OpenAI Gym using these algorithms.

## Steps

### Dependencies
  
  1. Follow the instructions mentioned in [this](https://github.com/openai/gym) repository to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.
    
  2. Install the dependencies 
    
          git clone https://github.com/saswat0/peely.git
          cd peely/python
          pip install .
